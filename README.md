# BismuthOS
BismuthOS is a lightweight and simple operating system built completely from scratch. This was my project a long time ago, so I just wanted to publish it here for others to use (If you don't wanna use linux). I'm not gonna work too much on this since i have other projects, but its nice to have this here!
